# 🔭 Example app image comparison


[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://cohort.streamlitapp.com/)

This is a reproduction of the fantastic WebbCompare app by John Christensen. 

It's built in Streamlit and takes only 10 lines of Python code, Thanks to Fatih’s mighty `Streamlit-Image-Comparison` component!
