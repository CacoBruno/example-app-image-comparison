# ðŸ”­ Example app image comparison

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://image-comparison.streamlitapp.com/)

This is a reproduction of the fantastic [WebbCompare](https://github.com/JohnEdChristensen/WebbCompare) app by John Christensen!

It's built in Streamlit and takes only 10 lines of Python code, Thanks to Fatihâ€™s mighty `Streamlit-Image-Comparison` [component](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-image-comparison/)!
